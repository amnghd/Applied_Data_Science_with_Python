#A fun visual story about a region

This is the project output for the "Applied Ploting,  Charting & Data Representation Course" by the University of Michigan. [Here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting/notebook/lVxma/project-description) is a link to the project definition.

- You need to identify two publicly accessible dataset from the same region "that are consistent across a meaningful dimension".

- You will state a research question that can be answered using these data sets.

- You create a visual using matplotlib to address your stated research questions.

- You will justify how your visual addresses your research question.




## Rubrics:

- State region and domain category (e.g. China, sport)

- Create a research question about the domain

- Provide two links to publicly accesible datasets (wikipedia, csv, etc)

- Upload an image with your question responded

- Write a short (1-2 Paragraph) justification on how you did the visualization.

- You need to describe and relate your visual in regards to Cairo's principles of:
 1. truthfulness (avoiding misleading representation)
 2. beauty (color, fonts, layout should be appropriate)
 3. functionality (e.g. choosing charting type that is appropriate for the research question),
 4. insightfulness (i.e. producing an "aha" response in the viewer)
